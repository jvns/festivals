Her work as an Indigenous Archaeologist often centers on challenging colonial perspectives in historical research, particularly in relation to how Indigenous communities are portrayed. She consistently critiqued the way Western Archaeology has traditionally framed Indigenous Peoples and their histories, often reducing them to artifacts or “static” cultures, rather than recognizing their dynamic, evolving cultures and identities. Her cultural advocacy work focuses on Indigenous sovereignty, decolonization, and the preservation of Indigenous Knowledge systems. Aiming to bridge the gaps between Indigenous worldviews and mainstream academic practices. This community-based approach allows for the preservation and revitalization of knowledge that may otherwise be lost or overlooked. Katsi’tsahén:te Cross-Delisle stands as an important figure in the intersection of archaeology, cultural preservation, and Indigenous rights, playing a key role in the ongoing efforts to decolonize Archaeology and ensure that Indigenous Peoples are the primary custodians of their own history and cultural heritage.</p><p>Registration link :</p><p><a href=\"https://www.zeffy.com/ticketing/workshop-echoes-across-the-water-stories-of-whales-trade-and-togetherness-animated-by-archeoquebec\">https://www.zeffy.com/ticketing/workshop-echoes-across-the-water-stories-of-whales-trade-and-togetherness-animated-by-archeoquebec</a></p>",

A natural poet, he loves to tell the Creation story, and help people to understand and appreciate the way he does. With the whale being sacred to the Mirning people and the tribe’s <em>totem</em>, he has used them as a symbol in recent years while campaigning against big oil and gas exploration within the Bight.</p><p>The story of Jeedara, the Great White Whale is central to Mirning lore. “He’s the totem, the creator of all the whales. The Seven Sisters, they didn’t like him at first but he sprayed them and put his magic on them and they looked at him again and thought he looked handsome. They fell in love with him, and the Mirning people, we all became the children as well as the other whales.”</p><p>The whales are <em>womooum</em> – “belonging as family”. Bunna is a whalesong man. “When you sing they come to you and they join in with you. We have the same law as the whale. My grandmother used to say they’re like policemen of the sea. They deal with law and order out there. If a shark attacks a dolphin, the whale will chase him away and give him a slap with the tail.” The whales of the Bight are sacred to the Mirning people.</p><p>WELCOME TO MONTREAL, BUNNA!</p><p>Sources</p><p><a href=\"https://greatsouthernreef.com/bunna-lawrie\">https://greatsouthernreef.com/bunna-lawrie </a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com.au/blogs/stories/bunna-lawrie-the-bight-goes-on-forever?srsltid=AfmBOoovstkW6NJfRjt6DmzFj3sEOOp22GDw-GxLOLA4czJp9tpFv2Kh\">https://www.patagonia.com.au/blogs/stories/bunna-lawrie-the-bight-goes-on-forever?srsltid=AfmBOoovstkW6NJfRjt6DmzFj3sEOOp22GDw-GxLOLA4czJp9tpFv2Kh</a></p>",

    "description": "Native Mafia Family (NMF) was born on the Maliotenam Mak Uashat reserve, an Indigenous community where Lildeuce24K, ImKoma YJ$, and Ismael all grew up. The group’s universe takes shape through the smoke of an altered reality. It is by emerging from this illusory world that the members come together to survive, tell their story with a rap background, and celebrate their Innu culture. Their first album, THE 27A’S, was released independently in 2023. The next album will be released under the Bienvenue Records label in the fall of 2024.",
