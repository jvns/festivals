    "description": "Brace yourselves! Fiery to the point of being brazen, always energetic and bold, Def Mama Def have no qualms about pushing boundaries. Channelling the spirit of Doudou N’Diaye Rose while championing the cause of women, these two powerful lionesses vigorously pound their drums,  merging the beats with their invigorating hip hop chants and crisp pop rhythms that include elements of trap, afrobeat and amapiano. “The most exciting and refreshing musical revelation to come out of Senegal since African folk and dance music first conquered the West’s music charts and concert stages” (Le Devoir, 2024).",

    "description": "Their first album, Nayda! (2020), named for Morocco’s new wave of counter-culture urban artists that led to a musical revolution, received widespread acclaim by major media outlets around the world. The band tours the globe with their “potion of supercharged, rock’n’roll ‘Gnawa of the future’” (RFI, 2024). Lovers of freedom, outraged by injustice, the Moroccan singer-songwriter Yousra Mansour and French musician Brice Bottin propel the amped-up sounds of guembris and aouicha far and wide, as if determined to make themselves heard. Drawing on the spirit of psychedelic rock, they usher gnawa trance, amazigh chants and chaabi polyrhythms into a new dimension. Their second album, Swaken, was released in 2024.",

This tireless artist is king and a purist when it comes to shatta, a completely Martinican subgenre of Jamaican dancehall that really stirs the soul. In his super-codified creations, though, you can sometimes pick out subtle hints of zouk and kompa, making them all the more tantalizing. On stage, everyone goes wild as the DJ gets down with his musicians and dancers, drawing the audience into the party. Blaiz Fayah is currently on a world tour to showcase his brand-new album, Shatta Ting.",

    "description": "“Her voice is so gentle that, in each of her songs, Naxx Bitota seems to want to take us into her arms,” praised Le Devoir following the launch of her album Kuetu in June 2022. In all her moods, from the most festive to the most melancholic, her smooth voice is remarkable, moving, resounding. Her stage presence is impressive. NAXX BITOTA’s joyful and endearing spirit embodies the strength, determination and splendor of the Congolese woman. At times she might remind us of Tchala Muana, Queen of Mutuashi. Other times, her Sebene-style rumba takes centre stage, with long, improvised guitar sequences, flirting with the Soukous beat. But NAXX BITOTA always adds her militant and personal  touch infused to modern afropop, making it all irresistible. Known for her music, which blends African rhythms with Afropop and Mutuashi, a unique traditional style from the Democratic Republic of Congo, NAXX BITOTA builds bridges between her native culture and all those she encounters throughout her career, particularly with Quebec, her adopted country for the past 16 years.\nShe will present her new album called “64” on July 15 during the 39th Edition of the  Festival International Nuit d’Afrique In a show that offers a unique sonic experience and focuses on sustainable development and the empowerment of women.",

With roulèr, kayamb, piker and sati rhythms providing the tempo, Kosé’s music is 100% maloya: as wild and refreshing as the ocean, as dense and precious as the forest, as rugged and impetuous as a volcano! Inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009, maloya retains the memory and mixed heritage of slaves from the past as a kind of protest anthem, and its quasi-sacred aura means that it is much more than traditional songs, music and dance—it has become the island’s identity.",

In late 2024, the group, whose leader Nedjim Bouizzoul is now based in Brittany, celebrated their fifth album to a full house at the Olympia in Paris and is now heading back to where it all began. With Nedjim’s impassioned, raspy voice accompanied by musicians of different origins, Labess delivers a gypsy-chaâbi that emphasizes the shared traits of popular Maghrebi and Eastern European rhythms in an ambience reminiscent of the exuberance of Algerian dance celebrations, where melancholy is swallowed up by the festivities. The group’s latest album, Dima libre, was released in 2024.",

She went on to hone her skills at the Institut National des Arts et de l’Action Culturelle and the reputable Village Ki-Yi arts centre in Abidjan. At the 2023 Jeux de la Francophonie, she won Bronze and was the 2024 MASA winner of the “Prix Henriette Dagri Diabaté de la création feminine.”  Her afrolight music, in which you can feel the magic of Africa’s forests and savannahs, features the ahoko, traditional instrument of the Baule people, combined with modern influences such as reggae, coupé-décalé, even slam and rap.

With her powerful, majestic voice, at times reaching a fiery pitch, her impassioned delivery and graceful gestures, Djely Tapa has become the new voice of mandinka music. Daughter of the celebrated Kandia Kouyaté, Djely descends from a long line of illustrious griots and has earned several Juno awards, including for Global Music Album of the Year, 2025. Through her music, she explores a language that looks outwards and towards the future, synthesizing her heritage and afro-futuristic aspirations in a universe where traditional rhythms mingle with Malian blues and electro. At times ethereal, at others dangerously danceable, her songs, which pay homage to women and to Africanness, are loaded with metaphor and imbued with wisdom. She has collaborated with the likes of Tiken Jah Fakoly and Vieux Farka Touré, who also features on her 2024 album Dankoroba (Disques Nuits d’Afrique).",

Salsa emerged organically from immigrant communities in the heart of the Big Apple, with a melting pot of rhythms propelled by the Latin American diaspora, especially Cuban and Puerto Rican, in a bursting effort to forge a distinct identity against a backdrop of social demands. Inspired by the improvisational spirit of jazz and rock, it is a fusion of genres that emphasize the African roots of the traditional rhythms that have shaped Caribbean folk music since the 16th century. Team Salsa Sextet cultivates this passion for life, for being alive and for dancing, through the fervour of percussion and power of brass vibes.",

Spontaneous, natural and committed, the 2019 Prix Découverte RFI finalist writes what she feels and sets her words to popular Cameroonian rhythms, rap and reggae while always taking esthetic appeal into account. The slam artist, recognized as a Young African Leader by the Mandela Washington Fellowship in 2024, uses music to support her chanted and sometimes outright sung lyrics, seeing this as a way of democratizing her art. Her latest EP, Fragile (2024), is available on all platforms.",

In high school, he nurtured his musical gift and soon became the star attraction at his school’s concerts. This reputation has stuck with him and still now, when he takes to the stage, his natural charisma is on full display as he embraces his showman status. This captivating bassist from Douala, inspired by Richard Bona, Petit Pays and Étienne Mbappé, delivers a makossa groove that doesn’t hide its similarity to Congolese soukous. An irresistible invitation to dance… Let’s groove!",

Surdo, conga, snare drum, tambourine, repinique, chocalho—percussion instruments reign supreme with this exuberant group that delivers a powerful mix of Samba de Roda, Samba de Cabula, maracatu and other Afro-Brazilian rhythms in rapid tempo. Formed in 2022 by Carlos Henrique Feitosa, this lively collective, with its jazzy, spiced up improvisations and upbeat vocals, certainly holds its own against anything coming out of the famous Brazilian samba schools.",

Since the ’50s, always in step with the times and never losing any of its appeal, konpa has been encapsulating Haitian Romanticism in styled rhythms where synthesizers dictate the tempo while maintaining the méringue and twoubadou groove.

Can we call him a legend? There’s no doubt about it. For over 30 years, this irreverent and funny showman has been performing all over the world with his unique and timeless “Zoblazo,” a style he invented and which he adapts to all kinds of styles and trends.

Chaâbi is kasbah jazz; unlike art music, it is not written down but rather passed down orally from one chaâbi master to another. It conveys friendship, love and everyday concerns. Algerian mandole, banjo, violine, guitar, mandolin, oud, tar, piano, darbouka… Since 2017, the twenty or so musicians and choir members of the Orchestre Chaâbi de Montréal (OCM) have been performing in harmony in order to share Algeria’s Arab and Kabyle folk heritage. From El Hachemi Guerouabi to Amar Ezzahi, Dahmane El Harrachi, Lounis Aït Menguellet, or Lounès Matoub, the OCM’s repertoire reveals the passion of this beautiful tradition that brings together Maghrebian poetry and Andalusi-Arabic music.",
